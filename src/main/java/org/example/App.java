Working with Strings



1. What is the length of the String: "Java" ?

1. What char is at index position 6 in the following String:
"Long example sentence" ?

2. What is the index position of 'o' in the following String:
"Even longer example sentence" ?

3. Given the following String: "Ok this is not as long!"
create a substring of only "not as long" (excluding the
exclamation point) and print it out.

4. Convert the following String: "CAPS EQUALS SCREAMING" to
lowercase and print it out. Then convert it back to
uppercase and print it out again.

5. Correct the following String: "Java is the worst
programming language!" by replacing the (obviously
incorrect) word "worst" with the word "best". Then print
out the sentence.

6. What is the output of the following String:
"\tJ\ta\tv\ta\t" after you trim it?

7. Parse the following int: 20 to a String and add a 20 to the
end of the String. Printing it out should return: "2020".

8. Oil and water don't go well together. Given the String:
"Oil and Water", split them up into the words "Oil","Water"
and store them in a String array.

9. Split the following String: "Carl,Susie,Fredrick,Bob,Erik"
into an array. Print out all names separately.

10. Convert the following String: "ThisShouldBeConverted" to
a char array. Iterate through the char array and print out
each element.

11. Convert the following char[]: {'J','a','v','a'} to a
String and print it out.
